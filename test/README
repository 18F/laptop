Testing for the `git-seekrets` is performed via a testing framework called
[BATS](https://github.com/sstephenson/bats).  To create an associated test
for new seekrets rulesets, it is necessary to install BATS.   More
information on installation is located in the `seekrets.bats` script.

Below is an example invocation for running the seekrets test with
BATS:

        bats --tap seekrets.bat


More information on the TAP format is available at the following
